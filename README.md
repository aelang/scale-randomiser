# scale-randomiser

Python code which takes all the scales for an ABRSM music exam and delivers them, one by one, to the user in a random order. 
Variations on articulation chosen by the examiner (eg. legato/staccato on the piano, or tongued/slurred on a brass instrument) are randomised.

The four scripts here work for the following grades and instruments, following the ABRSM syllabus (see https://gb.abrsm.org/en/our-exams/):

- Grade 5 piano
- Grade 8 piano
- Grade 5 flute
- Grade 5 trumpet

If you are playing a different instrument or a different grade, replace the list of scales with the ones that apply to you.

_Note: the ABRSM changes its syllabi and its scales every so often, so ensure you check that you are working from the most recent syllabus._
